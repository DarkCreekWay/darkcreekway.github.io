## About DarkCreekWay's Toolbox

Modern operating systems provide users with a wide range of functions.

Basic on-board tools are included with the operating systems for important
maintenance and repair work.

However, rarely are there tools for coping with everyday work among them.

The tools from **DarkCreekWay's Toolbox**

* close function and comfort gaps
* make computer work more intuitive, faster and more efficient
* reduce WTF-moments and decrease stress at the PC

Have fun :-)
